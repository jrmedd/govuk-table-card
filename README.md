# GOVUK Prototype kit table card plugin

This plugin transforms standard table rows into vertically stacked cards on smaller viewports, ensuring better usability on mobile devices while maintaining full accessibility. The table will function as a typical table when read by a screen reader, preserving the correct semantics.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: Automatically [switches between a traditional table layout and card layout](#example-output) based on the viewport width.
- **Accessible**: Maintains [table semantics for screen readers](#accessibility), ensuring tabular data remains accessible.
- **Customisable**: Supports custom captions, headers, and row content.

## Installation

To install the plugin, add it to your project using NPM:

```bash
npm install govuk-table-card-plugin
```
